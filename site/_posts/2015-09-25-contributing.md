Interested in contributing to <tt>proselint</tt>? Great &mdash; there are plenty of ways you can help. In the following sections, we describe how you can help us build <tt>proselint</tt> into the greatest writing tool in the world.  Work on <tt>proselint</tt> happens over <a href="http://github.com/amperser/proselint/">on Github</a>

## Coding
Have coding skills? You can:

+ Implement a new piece of advice. In our issue tracker, we maintain an ever-growing [list of rules](https://github.com/amperser/proselint/labels/rule) that have been extracted from expert advice on writing. Some of these are one-liners; others are research projects (see ). Use our templates to create a check that implements the advice. Then open a pull request.
+ Create a plugin for a new text editor. We currently have a plugin for Sublime Text plugin and a web editor. Many [more are needed](https://github.com/amperser/proselint/labels/plugin), most notably Microsoft Word, emacs, vim, and Google Docs.
+ Fix [bugs](https://github.com/amperser/proselint/labels/bug).
+ Improve [performance](https://github.com/amperser/proselint/labels/speed).
+ Write tests. Our test coverage is too low.

## Writing and editing
Have writing or editing skills? You can:

+ Extract rules from expert sources of advice. Read through some entries of a book like *Garners Modern American Usage* find rules that are feasible to implement in code, and then [open an issue on Github](https://github.com/amperser/proselint/issues/new). Here's an [example](https://github.com/amperser/proselint/issues/163) of a successfully extracted rule. And here's a list of [sources](https://github.com/amperser/proselint/labels/extraction) from which rules can be extracted.
+ Find false alarms. Run <tt>proselint</tt> over your favorite books or magazine articles â€” maybe even some of your own writing, and find places where <tt>proselint</tt> says that there is an error, but in reality, there is none. [open an issue on Github] describing the problem.
+ Improve the copy on this website or write documentation in the code.
