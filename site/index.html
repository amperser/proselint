<h1>A linter for prose.</h1>

<p><tt>proselint</tt> places the world&rsquo;s greatest writers and editors by your side, where they whisper suggestions on how to improve your prose. You&rsquo;ll be guided by Bryan Garner, David Foster Wallace, Chuck Palahniuk, Steve Pinker, Mary Norris, Mark Twain, Elmore Leonard, George Orwell, Matthew Butterick, William Strunk, E.B. White, Philip Corbett, Ernest Gowers, and the editorial staff of the world&rsquo;s finest literary magazines and newspapers. Others are on their way and will arrive soon. Our goal is to aggregate knowledge about best practices in writing and to make that knowledge immediately accessible to all authors in the form of a linter for prose. We call it <tt>proselint</tt>.</p>

<p><tt>proselint</tt> is a command-line utility and web API that is meant to be integrated into other tools. It&rsquo;s free for personal use. Commercial licenses are available.</p>

<p>With time, <tt>proselint</tt> will become fast, precise, exhaustive, and authoritative. Eventually, it will be unthinkable to write without it by your side.</p>
