`proselint` places the world's greatest writers and editors by your side, where they whisper suggestions on how to improve your prose. You'll be guided by Bryan Garner, Mark Twain, David Foster Wallace, Steve Pinker, Mary Norris, Chuck Palahniuk, Elmore Leonard, Matthew Butterick, staff at The Wall Street Journal, William Strunk, and E.B. White. Many others are on their way and will arrive shortly. The goal here is to aggregate human knowledge about best practices in writing and then to make that knowledge immediately accessible to all authors in the form of a linter for prose. We call it `proselint`.

### Installation

To get this up and running as a command line utility, run `python setup.py develop` from inside the root directory.

```
$ python setup.py develop
```

### API

```js
proselint --json

The output is a JSON structure with the following format:

    // Level of importance

    level: "warning",

    // Line where the error occurred.
    line: 0,

    // Column where the error occurred.
    column: 10,

    // Index in the text
    start: 10,

    // Size of the section in the text
    end: 2,

    // Message to describe the suggestion

    // Replacements suggestion
    replacements: [
        {

        }
    ]
}
```
