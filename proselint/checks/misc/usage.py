Strunk & White say:
1. Form the possessive singular of nouns by adding 's.
2. In a series of three or more terms with a conjunction, use a comma after
each term except the last.
3. Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas. ("This rule is difficult to
apply.")
4. Place a comma before a conjunction introducing an independent clause.
5. Do not join independent clauses with a comma; use a semi-colon. Or a period.
6. Do not break sentences in two. Do not use periods for the role of commas.
7. Use a colon after an independent clause if you introduce: a list of
particulars, an appositive, an application, or an illustrative quotation.
8. Use a dash to set off an abrupt break or interruption and to announce a
long appositive or summary.
9. The number of the subject determines the number of the verb. (MDPNB: This
will require nltk & syntactic parsing)
10. Use the proper case(grammatical gender) of pronouns.
    * MDPNB: hard case: "Give this work to whoever looks idle." `whoever looks
    idle` is the object of `to`.
11. A participial phrase at the beginning of a sentence must refer to the
grammatical subject.
