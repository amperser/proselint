Strunk & White say:
1. Choose a suitable design and hold to it.
    * MDPNB: Sounds like a principle of `consistency`.
2. Make the paragraph the unit of composition.
    * MDPNB: This can be generalized to say something about variability in the
    length of paragraphs and sentences. When any device is too often used it
    becomes a mannerism.
    * MDPNB: Sounds like a principle of `variation`.
3. Use the active voice.
4. Put statements in positive form.
    * MDPNB: In some cases this will apply as an invective against the use of
    a double negative.
    * Ex: He was not very often on time. -> He usually came late.
    * Ex:
4.1. Placing negative and positive in oposition makes for a stronger structure.
    * Ex. Not charity, but simple justice.
    * Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome more.
4.2. Do not use unnecessary auxillaries or conditionals.
5. Use definite, specific, concrete language.
    * A period of unfavorable weather set in. ->It rained every day for a week.
6. Omit needless words.
    * `The fact that` is particularly pernicious.
    * `who is, which was` and the like are often superfluous
7. Avoid a succession of loose sentences.
    * MDPNB Principle of brevity. Take 2.
8. Express coordinate ideas in similar form.
    * MDPNB: Prinicple of parrallel structure.
    * MDPNB: This one will be hard...
9. Keep related words together.
    * MDPNB: Principle of localism in semantics.
10. In summaries, keep to one tense.
    * MDPNB: Principle of temporal consistency.
11. Place the emphatic word of a sentence at the end.
    * MDPNB: Principle of recency.
